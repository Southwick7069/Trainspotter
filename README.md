# Trainspotter
""" This is a series of programs that project an image via a projecter onto a manikin. The projection makes the manikin appear to "speak" the audio content
The projector has a sleep mode and is "woken " by visitor activity in the museum where the display is used
The audio is projected in a cone to limit its spread.
